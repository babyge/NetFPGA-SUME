3. Cores
- axi_sim_transactor_v1_0_0: drives an AXI Stream slave using stimuli from an AXI grammar formatted text file
- axis_sim_pkg_v1_0_0: stream simulation I/O support package
- axis_sim_record_v1_0_0: records traffic received from an AXI Stream master to an AXI grammar formatted text file
- axis_sim_stim_v1_0_0: drives an AXI Stream slave using stimuli from an AXI grammar formatted text file
- barrier_gluelogic_v1_0_0/ barrier_v1_0_0: aggregates barrier good notifications from individual modules and pushes out a global barrier good notification when all modules are ready
